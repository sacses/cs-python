# Data Analyst Assignment

Hello and welcome to my repo, where I included my submission with the responses to a Data Analyst technical assignment that I completed as part of the interview process at a Fintech start-up.

The assignment comprised using SQL and Python to extract insights from the dataset, based on some growth metrics, forecast the daily user conversion rate and infer what there reasons were behind the trend seen

You will find the latest version of the results in the assignment notebook within the notebooks directory. You will see other packages that have been created to run the python program, although this has not been completed due to time constraints.

I hope that you find the insights interesting and I'll look forward to your feedback, specially tips on other important insights that you may miss in the assignment! :)
